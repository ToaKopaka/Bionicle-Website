Onua controlled Earth; he could raise walls and control soil. He was skilled at tunneling, helping Onu-Matoran in their mining. He had great night vision and disliked too much light. He carried claws as a Toa Mata and they were replaced by Quake Breakers (which could be used as All-Terrain Treaders) when he transformed into a Toa Nuva. Also, as a Toa of Earth, he had a high degree of physical strength, able to lift or throw huge boulders with ease. He came to the island wearing the Pakari, Great Mask of Strength (enhancing his strength even further). While he was a normal Toa Nuva, he wore a Pakari Nuva, one of the Kanohi Nuva. As a Mistika he carries a Multi-Resistance Shield and a Nynrah Ghost Blaster with a laser sight.

        <tr>
Onua was wise but quiet, even allowing the other Toa Nuva to split up even when he knew it was a mistake. He was in a way the conscience of the Toa. He has good relations with all of the other Toa, especially Pohatu. Onua did not often speak unless he had something important to say.
