        <tr>Bionicle (/baɪˈɒnɪ.kəl/) was a line of Lego construction toys marketed primarily towards 8-to-16 year-olds. Originally a subsidiary of Lego's Technic series, the line launched in Europe and Australasia in 2000 and in the Americas in 2001. Over the following decade, it became one of Lego's biggest-selling properties; turning into a franchise and playing a part in saving the company from its financial crisis of the late 1990s. Despite a planned twenty-year tenure, the theme was discontinued in 2010, but was rebooted in 2015 for a further two years.</tr><br>
        <tr>
          Unlike previous Lego themes, Bionicle was accompanied by an original story told across a multimedia spectrum. It depicts the exploits of the Toa, heroic biomechanical beings with innate elemental abilities whose duty is to maintain peace throughout their universe. Bionicle's success prompted subsequent Lego themes to utilize similar story-telling methods.

          Set in a science fantasy universe featuring a diversity of cyborgs during a time period predating recorded history, the main narrative details the exploits of the Toa, heroic beings with elemental powers whose duty is to maintain peace by protecting the Matoran – the prime populace of their world – and their mission to reawaken the Great Spirit Mata Nui, their god-like figure who has fallen into a coma-like state by the actions of the evil Makuta. Typically, characters such as the Toa and Matoran are divided into tribes based on six elements: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Stone and Ice. Other elements are later introduced.</tr>
